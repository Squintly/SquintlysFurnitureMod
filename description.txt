A furniture mod inspired by the likes of Terrarchitect and Dragon's Decorative Mod, this is my attempt to fill in some of the gaps, mostly for my own personal building purposes.

[h1]Current Content:[/h1]
There are now officially over 600 items in the mod! Whoo!
[h2]Vanilla Plus[/h2]
These are things which use vanilla sprites or are based on vanilla objects, such as:
[list]
[*] Placeable & Invincible Plants, Vines, Thorns, Reeds, Cobewbs and more
[*] Small Versions of Animal Skins & Treasure Map
[*] Sandstone Pillars, Blocks and Platforms that match the Yellow Bricks
[*] Visual Variants of Vanilla Items like Barrels
[*] Placeable Rope Coils and Hanging Fish
[/list]
[h2]Extra Items for Existing Sets[/h2]
Ever wanted a type of furniture that doesn't exist? That's these!
[list]
[*] 1x1 Ceiling Lamps
[*] 2x2 Armchairs
[*] Front-facing Royal Beds
[/list]
[h2]New Furniture Sets[/h2]
Complete with all vanilla furniture items, as well as my set extras! Lights can be turned off with wires or right-click, and all function for NPC housing requirements
[list]
[*] Tattered: Made like generic set, but with Ecto Mist
[*] Festive: Made at the Festive Crafting Table, using Candy Cane & Pine

[h2]Themed Decorations[/h2]
Not a lot of these yet, but going forward there'll be more!

[/list]
[h2]Holiday Decorations[/h2]
There are too many of these. Includes ribbons, bunting, figurines, toys, banners, decals, tools, containers, and more!

[*] Valentines: Mostly made at the Hearfelt Crafting Table
[*] Halloween: Mostly made at the Decoration Box
[*] New Years: Mostly made at the Decoration Box
[/list]
More's being added all the time, though updates may be sporadic at times. [b]Please report any bugs or unexpected behavior[/b]. Due to the size of the mod, playtesting everything is increasingly difficult. 
Suggestions, questions and comments are very welcome, especially on the new [url=https://discord.gg/DYAqssHdMz]Discord[/url] server, where I post previews and ask opinions. If you've used my mod to build something neat, please share! I'm excited to see what y'all can do with all this!
