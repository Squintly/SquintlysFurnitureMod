A furniture mod inspired by the likes of Terrarchitect and Dragon's Decorative Mod, this is my attempt to fill in some of the gaps, mostly for my own personal building purposes.

CURRENT CONTENT:
- 7 hanging fish based off the non-potion fish, all 2x3
- 1 smaller string of fish (2x2) and a tiny cluster (1x2)
- 3x2 placeable rope coil
- A decorative (and thus invincible!) cobweb
- 2 barrels with decorative foodstuffs
- 2x2 versions of the vanilla animal skins and treasure map
- Silk flowers and grass, so you can swing your sword in peace
- Hieroglyphic blocks and walls, including faded versions
- Polished sandstone brick blocks and walls
- Sandstone brick platforms
- Egyptian-themed obelisks, in whole and broken variants
- 1x1 ceiling lamps for all sets + dungeon lanterns! 

More will be added with time, though updates may be sporadic. I've also never coded anything before, so please forgive any... rough patches. (For example, I cannot make the cobwebs act like a normal block and I have no idea how to fix this. Also: opacity.)
Suggestions and tips are welcome!

Note: the ceiling lamps turned out to be more complicated than I thought, and I need a little break after finally figuring them out. Also: 1.4.4 :P It might be a while before another update, unless I get any bug reports, which will obviously take priority. Thanks for all the support, it's really been inspiring!
